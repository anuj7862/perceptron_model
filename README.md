# perceptron_model
In this project I made a perceptron model in processing software in which for every mouse click it's train itself for 100 iterations and you can viewlize the result after each action.
Here we have two classes 1 and 0...

Red ponints in images denote that they are predicted wrong by the model and green points denote that are predicted right by the model.
